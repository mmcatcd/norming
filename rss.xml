      <title>Credit or Debit?</title>
      <link>https://normi.ng/credit-or-debit</link>
      <description>
        Recently while visiting the United States I noticed that nearly every time I used my debit card to make a payment I was asked if I would like to pay with "credit or debit". Curiosity took the better
        of me and I occassionally said "Credit" to see what would happen. The payment still successfully went through each time. If it would work either way, why ask the question?

      <title>Film Frame Rates</title>
      <link>https://normi.ng/frame-rates</link>
      <description>
        In December 2009, the first Avatar film was released in cinemas. The film pushed the boundaries of what was possible in cinema at the time, and made the film industry consider strongly the use of 3D.
        Twelve years later, James Cameron is back at it again, this time experimenting with high frame rates.

      <title>The 12 Note Tuning System</title>
      <link>https://normi.ng/music-notes</link>
      <description>
        There are 12 notes in the Western system of tuning and I've always been curious as to why we settled on 12 notes in particular. A 10 note system seemed particularly logical to me.
        It turns out that the answer is somewhat of a mystery.
