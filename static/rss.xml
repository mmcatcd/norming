      Happy leap year! It's pretty easy to figure out when we have a leap year, right? Nothing about time is what it seems. Let's find out why.

      Most people feel a sense of security when they lock something that they own. But this sense of security is misplaced. Most locks that we use in our homes can be picked in a few minutes flat. So why do we still use them?

      If you live in one of 70 odd countries with Daylight Saving Time, changing your clocks twice a year is a normal part of life. But in the rest of the world in this day and age, this practice seems bizarre. Should we just do away with it altogether?

      If you've ever had the displeasure of dividing up an A4 sheet of paper with a ruler, you'll know that it measures 210x297mm. Conveniently short enough to measure with a standard ruler. But the question remains, why 297mm and not the more convenient 300mm?

      If I wanted to buy a new car in 1910, I'd have three drivetrain options to choose from, steam, internal combustion or electricity. Over 100 years later, electricity is making a comeback again. Does history have any hints as to how successful we might be this time?

    <title>A Sign of the Times</title>
    <link>https://normi.ng/a-sign-of-the-times</link>
    <description>
      An unfortunate paradox of successful typefaces is that, the more wide their use is, the less noticeable they become. And there is possibly no typeface that this is more true for than Times New Roman. So how did it reach such ubiquity that it became a icon of the word processing age? And how did it ultimately eventually fall out of fashion?

    <description>
      Recently while visiting the United States I noticed that nearly every time I used my debit card to make a payment I was asked if I would like to pay with "credit or debit". Curiosity took the better of me and I occassionally said "Credit" to see what would happen. The payment still successfully went through each time. If it would work either way, why ask the question?

    <description>
      In December 2009, the first Avatar film was released in cinemas. The film pushed the boundaries of what was possible in cinema at the time, and made the film industry consider strongly the use of 3D. Twelve years later, James Cameron is back at it again, this time experimenting with high frame rates.

    <title>The 12 Note Tuning System</title>

      There are 12 notes in the Western system of tuning and I've always been curious as to why we settled on 12 notes in particular. A 10 note system seemed particularly logical to me. It turns out that the answer is somewhat of a mystery.
