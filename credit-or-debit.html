      <div class="episode-content">Recently while visiting the United States I noticed that nearly every time I used my debit card to make a
payment I was asked if I would like to pay with "credit or debit". Curiosity took the better of me and I
occassionally said "Credit" to see what would happen. The payment still successfully went through each time.
If it would work either way, why ask the question?
