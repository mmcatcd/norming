  Some European countries like France or Italy are known for incredible food cultures. Ireland on the other hand,
  is better known for their drinking than eating. Our Whiskey's and Coffee's are fairly well known worldwide,
  but we’re probably best known for Guinness. It is, after all, our national drink. So what makes a national drink,
  and why is Guinness ours?
