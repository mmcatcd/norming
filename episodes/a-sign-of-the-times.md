  An unfortunate paradox of successful typefaces is that, the more wide their use is,
  the less noticeable they become. And there is possibly no typeface that this is more
  true for than Times New Roman. So how did it reach such ubiquity that it became a icon
  of the word processing age? And how did it ultimately eventually fall out of fashion?
